# 15. OOP

this chapter: inheritance and dynamic binding

## 15.1 OOP: an overview

virtual member function: implementation is type-dependent

## 15.2 Defining Base and Derived Classes

virtual destructor is widely used in the root class

derived class should inherit the function without change or provides its own implementation(override)

calling a virtual function through reference or pointer: dynamically bound

any non-static member function **except for the constructor** may be *virtual*, virtual keyword is only used inside the class

member function declared as virtual in the base class is **implicitly virtual** in derived class

non-virtual function: behavior is fixed at compile time

public/private member of base class: derived classes can/cannot access; protected member: only derived classes can access

---

public/private/protected derivation: whether the user of the derived class knows that it is derived from the base class

public inheritance: public member functions are also inherited

C++ also supports multiple inheritance

---

if derived class does not override a virtual function, it just inherits

---

derived-to-base conversion:

```cpp
Derived d;
Base &r = d;
Base *p = &d;
```

In terms of the memory layout, the derived class contains the member it inherits from the base class.

However, we cannot directly initialize the base-class part. Instead, we have to rely on the constructor of the base class(or default initialized).

order of the initialization: firstly the base-class part, and then the member of the derived class as they are declared

---

static members: only one each irrespective of the number of the derived classes

---

preventing inheritance:

```cpp
class Final final {};
class Last final: public Base {};
```

---

no implicit conversion from base to derived

to convert from `Base*` to `Derived*`(if the type of the object the pointer points to is correct), we can use `static_cast`(if we can guarantee the correctness) or `dynamic_cast`(with runtime check)

conversion from `Derived` to `Base`, through constructor/assignment operation function, **drop** extra members

## 15.3 Virtual Functions

dynamic binding happens if: the member function is virtual & the caller is a reference or pointer

member functions can also be declared as `final`

use a version forcefully(thus it is determined at compile time): `baseP->Quote::net_price(42)`, which is mostly used inside member function implementations

## 15.4 Abstract Base Classes

## 15.5 Access Control and Inheritance

protected members: user of derived classes cannot access; friends and member functions or derived classes can access **through the derived class**

too complicated...

## 15.6 Class Scope under Inheritance

## 15.7 Constructors and Copy Control

order of construction: derived calls base
