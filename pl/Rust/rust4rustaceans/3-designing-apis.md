## Unsurprising

intuitive enough

### Naming

derived from common interfaces: for example, `iter, into_inner`

### Common Traits

users' expectation: `Debug, Clone, Sync, Send` and so on

coherence rule: users are not allowed to implement a foreign trait for a foreign type, instead, they should implement a wrapper

## Flexible

## Obvious

## Constrained
